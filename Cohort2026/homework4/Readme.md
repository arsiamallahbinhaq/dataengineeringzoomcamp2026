## Module 4 Homework: Analytics Engineering with dbt
In this homework, we'll use the dbt project in 04-analytics-engineering/taxi_rides_ny/ to transform NYC taxi data and answer questions by querying the models.

# Setup
Set up your dbt project following the setup guide
Load the Green and Yellow taxi data for 2019-2020 into your warehouse
```
Run dbt build --target prod to create all models and run tests
```
Note: By default, dbt uses the dev target. You must use --target prod to build the models in the production dataset, which is required for the homework queries below.

After a successful build, you should have models like fct_trips, dim_zones, and fct_monthly_zone_revenue in your warehouse.

# Question 1. dbt Lineage and Execution
Given a dbt project with the following structure:
```
models/
├── staging/
│   ├── stg_green_tripdata.sql
│   └── stg_yellow_tripdata.sql
└── intermediate/
    └── int_trips_unioned.sql (depends on stg_green_tripdata & stg_yellow_tripdata)
```
If you run dbt run --select int_trips_unioned, what models will be built?
```
stg_green_tripdata, stg_yellow_tripdata, and int_trips_unioned (upstream dependencies) --> answer
Any model with upstream and downstream dependencies to int_trips_unioned
int_trips_unioned only
int_trips_unioned, int_trips, and fct_trips (downstream dependencies)
```

# Question 2. dbt Tests
You've configured a generic test like this in your schema.yml:

```
columns:
  - name: payment_type
    data_tests:
      - accepted_values:
          arguments:
            values: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
            quote: false
```
Your model fct_trips has been running successfully for months. A new value 6 now appears in the source data.

What happens when you run dbt test --select fct_trips?

```
dbt will skip the test because the model didn't change
dbt will fail the test, returning a non-zero exit code --> answer
dbt will pass the test with a warning about the new value
dbt will update the configuration to include the new value
```


# Question 3. Counting Records in fct_monthly_zone_revenue
After running your dbt project, query the fct_monthly_zone_revenue model.

What is the count of records in the fct_monthly_zone_revenue model?
```
12,998
14,120
12,184 --> answer
15,421
```

```
select count(*) from prod.fct_monthly_zone_revenue;

┌──────────────┐
│ count_star() │
│    int64     │
├──────────────┤
│    12184     │
└──────────────┘
```

# Question 4. Best Performing Zone for Green Taxis (2020)
Using the fct_monthly_zone_revenue table, find the pickup zone with the highest total revenue (revenue_monthly_total_amount) for Green taxi trips in 2020.

Which zone had the highest revenue?
```
East Harlem North --> answer
Morningside Heights
East Harlem South
Washington Heights South
```

```
select pickup_zone, sum(revenue_monthly_total_amount) as total_revenue 
from prod.fct_monthly_zone_revenue 
where service_type='Green' and year(revenue_month) = 2020 
group by pickup_zone 
order by total_revenue desc limit 1;

┌───────────────────┬───────────────┐
│    pickup_zone    │ total_revenue │
│      varchar      │ decimal(38,3) │
├───────────────────┼───────────────┤
│ East Harlem North │  1817731.250  │
└───────────────────┴───────────────┘
```


# Question 5. Green Taxi Trip Counts (October 2019)
Using the fct_monthly_zone_revenue table, what is the total number of trips (total_monthly_trips) for Green taxis in October 2019?
```
500,234
350,891
384,624 --> answer 
421,509
```

```
select SUM(total_monthly_trips) 
FROM prod.fct_monthly_zone_revenue 
where service_type='Green' and revenue_month >= '2019-10-01' and revenue_month < '2019-11-01';

┌──────────────────────────┐
│ sum(total_monthly_trips) │
│          int128          │
├──────────────────────────┤
│          384624          │
└──────────────────────────┘
```

# Question 6. Build a Staging Model for FHV Data
Create a staging model for the For-Hire Vehicle (FHV) trip data for 2019.

Load the FHV trip data for 2019 into your data warehouse
Create a staging model stg_fhv_tripdata with these requirements:
Filter out records where dispatching_base_num IS NULL
Rename fields to match your project's naming conventions (e.g., PUlocationID → pickup_location_id)
What is the count of records in stg_fhv_tripdata?
```
42,084,899
43,244,693 --> answer
22,998,722
44,112,187
```

```
select count(*) 
┬╖ from prod.stg_fhv_tripdata;
┌─────────────────┐
│  count_star()   │
│      int64      │
├─────────────────┤
│    43244693     │
│ (43.24 million) │
└─────────────────┘
